# flaskmix
or flaskomix
or flask comics
whatever

this is a framework made in like a week to host a webcomic in because i don't like using wordpress, it makes me feel dirty and i don't like php either so i made this in python and flask. 


## Environment
make a .env file and add
```
COMIC_ADMIN_COOKIE= value of cookie that is accepted by the admin panel
COMIC_ADMIN_UNAME= admin username
COMIC_ADMIN_PW= admin password
```
